<section class="about-content">
    <p>Hello I am DaSkullBoy I like to spend time playing games or coding.
        My favorite food is Pizza and tacos I like to use Linux. My Favorite programming language
        is C since it compiles faster then other languages. And it's low level which means
        it is close the hardware and takes time to learn and you have to write more code.
        My favorite High Level programming language is Lua used for building games like
        Roblox which has it's own Lua version known as Luau there website is https://luau-lang.org
        but Lua is High level which means it takes more hardware resources and may sometimes
        run slower. I like other programming languages but C and Lua are ones I like. For more questions
